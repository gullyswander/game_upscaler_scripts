# PS2 Texture notes 

**Not sure how accurate my notes are here.**

PS2 textures refer to the graphical textures used in PlayStation 2 (PS2) video games. Textures in video games are bitmap images that are mapped onto the surfaces of 3D models to give them color and detail. In the context of the PS2, these textures had certain characteristics due to the hardware limitations and graphics capabilities of the console at the time. Here are some key points about PS2 textures:

1. **Resolution**: PS2 textures often had lower resolutions compared to modern standards due to the limited memory and processing power of the console. Common resolutions were 256x256 or 512x512 pixels, and sometimes even smaller textures were used to conserve memory.

2. **Format**: PS2 used various texture formats, including some proprietary ones. These formats were optimized for the PS2's Graphics Synthesizer (GS), which was the graphics processing unit of the console. Textures could be compressed to save memory, leading to a potential loss in detail.

3. **Color Depth**: The color depth of PS2 textures varied, but they often used 16-bit color to save memory space, compared to the 24-bit or 32-bit color seen in more modern systems. This meant that PS2 textures could display fewer colors and might have more noticeable color banding.

4. **Palette**: Some PS2 textures used palette-based color, where the texture image contained indices to a separate table of colors (the palette). This technique reduced the size of the textures.

5. **Mipmapping**: PS2 textures often used mipmapping, a technique where multiple versions of a texture are stored at different resolutions. The appropriate resolution would be used based on the distance of the texture from the camera, improving performance and reducing aliasing.

6. **Clut (Color Look-Up Table)**: The PS2 had a feature known as CLUT (Color Look-Up Table), which was a form of palette that textures could reference. This was especially useful for games that needed to have a large number of textures but were limited by memory constraints.

7. **Transparency**: Transparency in textures was handled using alpha channels or color keys. Alpha channels could provide smooth transitions between transparent and opaque areas, while color keys would define a specific color as transparent (commonly used in older or simpler graphics).

8. **Texture Filtering**: The PS2 supported bilinear and trilinear texture filtering, which smoothed out textures when viewed at an angle or from a distance, reducing pixelation and improving visual quality.

9. **Texture Mapping**: PS2 developers used various techniques for texture mapping, such as UV mapping, where each vertex of a 3D model is assigned specific coordinates that correspond to a point on the texture image.

10. **Memory Constraints**: The PS2 had 32 MB of RAM, which meant that developers had to be very efficient with texture use. Techniques such as tiling, where a small texture is repeated across a surface, and multi-texturing, where multiple textures are combined, were common practices.

11. **Upscaling and Modding**: Many modern gaming enthusiasts and modders upscale or enhance these original PS2 textures to make them look better on modern displays. This involves using software that can interpolate and add detail to the textures, which can then be used in PS2 emulators.

Textures were a critical aspect of PS2 game development, as they directly influenced the visual style and performance of a game. Modern techniques and tools, such as AI upscaling and emulation, allow these classic games to be experienced with improved textures on contemporary hardware.
